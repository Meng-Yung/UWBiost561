\title{Generate a Random Graph with a Partial Clique}
\usage{
generate_partial_clique(
  n,
  clique_fraction,
  clique_edge_density,
  density_rest = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Total number of nodes in the graph. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{clique_fraction}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Fraction of nodes to include in the partial clique. The actual number of clique nodes is round(n * clique_fraction).}

\item{clique_edge_density}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Target edge density among the nodes in the partial clique (e.g., 1 = fully connected, 0 = no edges).}

\item{density_rest}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Edge density for the rest of the graph outside the partial clique. Defaults to 0.1.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
adj_mat, An n x n symmetric adjacency matrix with binary entries (0 or 1), with 1s on the diagonal. A partial clique of appropriate size and density is embedded.
rev_order, An integer vector of length n indicating the permutation of node labels used to randomize the row/column order of the matrix.
